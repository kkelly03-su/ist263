    </head>
    <body>
        My name is Katherine Kelly, and I am a Policy Studies major with an Information Management and Technology minor at Syracuse University. I am interested in how data can predict different outcomes of policies being implemented in corporate companies. Some skills of mine are Microsoft proficiency, understanding policy development and enforcement, active listening skills, and smart time management. I have worked with the Police Athletics League as an advisor in policy and development of the company’s goals for the community. Outside of work, I am on the Men’s Rowing Team at Syracuse University as a coxswain, I am an avid reader, love new music, and spending time with my friends.
